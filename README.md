# Project Name

Interactive Web Visualizations with D3.js and Plotly

## Introduction

This project demonstrates interactive web visualizations using D3.js and Plotly. It fetches data from an external JSON source and creates dynamic bar charts, bubble charts, and displays metadata based on user interactions.

## Installation

There is no installation required for this project. It is a client-side web application, and you can simply run the HTML file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The web page will display a default bar chart, bubble chart, and metadata for the first sample.
4. Use the dropdown menu to select different samples, and the visualizations will update accordingly.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following libraries:

- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/): A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/): A JavaScript graphing library for interactive visualizations.

These libraries are included in the project's HTML file using CDN links, so you don't need to install anything separately.
